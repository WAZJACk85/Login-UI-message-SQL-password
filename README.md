# Login-message-connected-SQL

The scheme of this program, is a login user interface, which displays a success or failure message depending on the username and password details you have typed in.

The message occurs when you click login, and when you do this, it contacts my SQL database (locally in my laptop), sub database and tables and it asks the username table and the password table for the typed details.  If the typed information is correct the successful message appears.  If it is incorrect, the faiure message appears.

My intention is to create a follow on page if login success is true, and this next page will consist of guitar and audio technology.  Eventually it would be good to have 2 videos inserted in my portfolio website recording the local setup and then another video documenting a more complex app and database contacted in a remote server.
